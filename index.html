                <h2>What We Do</h2>
                <p>The Seattle Hadiya community association's mission is giving relief to the 
                    members in a time of financial hardship that happened because of death in his family.<br> 
                    When we say family, it means the family of both husband and wife sides.<br> 
                    Even if the association's target is giving financial hardship relief to its member, 
                    the association also provides some non-financial service.<br> 
                    Non-financial service includes treating the deceased family psychologically.
